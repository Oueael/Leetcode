Hint

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0

        max_sum = float('-inf')
        max_level = 1
        level = 1
        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            level_sum = 0
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level_sum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

            if level_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = level_sum
                max_level = level

            level += 1

        return max_level
