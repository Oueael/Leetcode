Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

    Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
    Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.
=============================
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        result = []

        def backtrack(start, path, total):
            if len(path) == k:
                if total == n:
                    result.append(path[:])
                return
            for i in range(start, 10):  # only numbers 1 to 9
                if total + i > n:
                    break
                path.append(i)
                backtrack(i + 1, path, total + i)
                path.pop()

        backtrack(1, [], 0)
        return result
