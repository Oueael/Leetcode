Hint

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            # If we included a zero in the window we reduce the value of k.
            # Since k is the maximum zeros allowed in a window.
            k -= 1 - nums[right]
            # A negative k denotes we have consumed all allowed flips and window has
            # more than allowed zeros, thus increment left pointer by 1 to keep the window size same.
            if k < 0:
                # If the left element to be thrown out is zero we increase k.
                k += 1 - nums[left]
                left += 1
        return right - left + 1
