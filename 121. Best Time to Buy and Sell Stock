You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

function maxProfit(prices) {
    let maxProfit = 0; // Initialize maxProfit to zero for cases where no profit is possible.

    // Loop through each day considering it as the buying day.
    for (let buyDay = 0; buyDay < prices.length; buyDay++) {

        // Compare the buying day with all possible selling days after the buying day.
        for (let sellDay = buyDay + 1; sellDay < prices.length; sellDay++) {
            // Calculate profit if sold on sellDay after buying on buyDay.
            let profit = prices[sellDay] - prices[buyDay];

            // Update maxProfit if the current profit is greater than the previously recorded maxProfit.
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
        }
    }
    return maxProfit; // Return the maximum profit found.
}
