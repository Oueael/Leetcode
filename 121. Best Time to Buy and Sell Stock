You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

function maxProfit(prices) {
    let minPrice = Infinity; // Initialize minPrice to infinity
    let maxProfit = 0; // Initialize maxProfit to 0
    
    // Loop through each price in the prices array
    for (let price of prices) {
        // If the current price is lower than minPrice, update minPrice
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price;
        } 
        // Otherwise, calculate the profit if the current price is sold and compare with maxProfit
        else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            // Update maxProfit if the profit is higher
            maxProfit = price - minPrice;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the maximum profit found
    return maxProfit
    }
