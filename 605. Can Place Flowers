605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

==========================================================
function canPlaceFlowers (flowerbed, n) {
    let count = 0 
    for (let i=0;i<flowerbed.length;i++){
        if(flowerbed[i]===0){
            let emptyPrev= (i===0)||(flowerbed[i-n]===0)
            let emptyNext=(i===flowerbed.length -1)||(flowerbed[i+1]===0)
            if (emptyPrev && emptyNext){
                flowerbed[i]===1
                count++
                if (count===n){
                    return true
                }
              }
          }
        }
    return count>=n
    }
================================================================
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    count = 0  # Number of flowers planted
    length = len(flowerbed)

    for i in range(length):
        if flowerbed[i] == 0:
            # Check previous plot (empty or doesn't exist)
            empty_prev = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
            # Check next plot (empty or doesn't exist)
            empty_next = (i == length - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)

            if empty_prev and empty_next:
                flowerbed[i] = 1  # Plant a flower
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return True  # Planted all flowers

    return count >= n
