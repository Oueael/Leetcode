Hint

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 15
    s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
    It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].


function romanToInt(s) {
  // Map Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values.
  const romanMap = {
    I: 1,
    V: 5,
    X: 10,
    L: 50,
    C: 100,
    D: 500,
    M: 1000
  };

  let total = 0; // Initialize total to 0 to keep track of the sum.

  // Loop through each character in the Roman numeral string.
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const current = romanMap[s[i]]; // Get the integer value of the current Roman numeral.
    const next = romanMap[s[i + 1]]; // Get the integer value of the next Roman numeral.

    // If the current value is less than the next value, it means we have a case like IV or IX.
    // According to Roman numeral rules, we need to subtract the current value from the total.
    // Otherwise, we simply add the current value to the total.
    if (next > current) {
      total -= current;
    } else {
      total += current;
    }
  }

  // Return the total after processing all characters.
  return total;
}
