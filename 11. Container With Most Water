Hint

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

def max_area(height):
    # Initialize two pointers, left at the start and right at the end
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    
    # Variable to store the maximum water container area
    max_area = 0

    # Iterate until the two pointers meet
    while left < right:
        # Calculate the height of the container (minimum of the two vertical lines)
        current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        
        # Calculate the width of the container (distance between the two pointers)
        width = right - left
        
        # Calculate the current area and update max_area if it's greater
        current_area = current_height * width
        max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
        
        # Move the pointer with the smaller height inward to try for a larger area
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    # Return the maximum area found
    return max_area

# Example usage
heights = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
print("Maximum area:", max_area(heights))
