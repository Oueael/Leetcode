Hint

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:

    # Step 1: Find the maximum number of candies any kid has
        max_candies = max(candies)

    # Step 2: Create an empty list to store the results
        results = []

    # Step 3: Loop through each kid's candies
        for candy in candies:
        # Add extraCandies to the current kid's candies
            new_total = candy + extraCandies

        # Check if the new total is greater than or equal to max_candies
            if new_total >= max_candies:
                results.append(True)  # The kid can have the greatest number of candies
            else:
                results.append(False)  # The kid cannot have the greatest number of candies

    # Step 4: Return the results list
        return results

function kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies) {
  // Step 1: Find the maximum number of candies any kid has
  let maxCandies = Math.max(...candies);

  // Step 2: Create an empty array to store the results
  let results = [];

  // Step 3: Loop through each kid's candies
  for (let i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
    // Add extraCandies to the current kid's candies
    let newTotal = candies[i] + extraCandies;

    // Check if the new total is greater than or equal to maxCandies
    if (newTotal >= maxCandies) {
      results.push(true); // The kid can have the greatest number of candies
    } else {
      results.push(false); // The kid cannot have the greatest number of candies
    }
  }

  // Step 4: Return the results array
  return results;
}

// Example usage:
let candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3];
let extraCandies = 3;
console.log(kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies)); // Output: [true, true, true, false, true]
