Hint

We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteriod in the array represent their relative position in space.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example 1:

Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        for asteroid in asteroids:
            # Handle collisions only when the current asteroid is moving left and the top of the stack is moving right
            while stack and asteroid < 0 and stack[-1] > 0:
                if stack[-1] < abs(asteroid):
                    stack.pop()  # The top asteroid explodes
                    continue
                elif stack[-1] == abs(asteroid):
                    stack.pop()  # Both asteroids explode
                    break
                else:
                    break  # The current asteroid explodes
            else:
                # If no collision or the current asteroid survives, add it to the stack
                stack.append(asteroid)
        return stack
