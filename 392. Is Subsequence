392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
===================================================
function isSubsequence(s, t) {
    let i = 0; // Pointer for string `s`
    let j = 0; // Pointer for string `t`

    // Traverse through both strings
    while (i < s.length && j < t.length) {
        // If characters match, move pointer `i` for `s`
        if (s[i] === t[j]) {
            i++;
        }
        // Always move pointer `j` for `t`
        j++;
    }

    // If `i` has reached the end of `s`, it means all characters were matched in order
    return i === s.length;
}
============================================
var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length > t.length) return false;
    if (s == "" && t.length == "") return true
    let sp = 0

    for(let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        if(t[i] === s[sp]) sp += 1;
