Hint

Given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.

def maxVowels(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    vowels = set('aeiou')  # Set of vowels for quick lookup
    max_vowels = 0
    current_vowels = 0

    # Count vowels in the first window of size k
    for i in range(k):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            current_vowels += 1

    max_vowels = current_vowels

    # Slide the window across the string
    for i in range(k, len(s)):
        # Remove the character that's sliding out of the window
        if s[i - k] in vowels:
            current_vowels -= 1
        # Add the new character that's sliding into the window
        if s[i] in vowels:
            current_vowels += 1

        # Update the maximum vowels count
        max_vowels = max(max_vowels, current_vowels)

    return max_vowels
