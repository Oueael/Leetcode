Hint

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
===========================

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            # Step 1: Initialize arrays to store prefix and suffix products
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n  # Result array initialized with 1s
        
        # Step 2: Calculate prefix products for each element
        prefix = 1  # Keeps track of the product of elements to the left of the current element
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix  # Store the current prefix product in the answer
            prefix *= nums[i]  # Update the prefix by multiplying the current number
        
        # Step 3: Calculate suffix products and combine with prefix products
        suffix = 1  # Keeps track of the product of elements to the right of the current element
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):  # Loop backward
            answer[i] *= suffix  # Multiply the current suffix product with the answer
            suffix *= nums[i]  # Update the suffix by multiplying the current number
        
        return answer
